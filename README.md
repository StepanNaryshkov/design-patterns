# Design patterns
*The notes are an important attempt to strengthen results in design patterns (JavaScript)*

[What is a design pattern?](#Design%20pattern%20is%20reisable%20solution%20to%20commonly%20occuring%20problems%20in%20sowftawe%20problems.)

Design pattern is reusable solution to commonly occuring problems in software design. In mostly cases you can not copy pattern in your project because pattern is not a piece of code and an exact solution but it is general concept for solving particular problems. Design patterns have three benefits:

 - Pattern is reusable solution;
 - Pattern is proven solution;
 - Pattern is expressive solution;
